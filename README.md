# Text-Analytics-and-Retrieval-for-Customer-Feedback

This project utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze five years of feedback data from the top 10 clients with the highest yearly purchases. The analysis focuses on three key areas: sales representatives, product offerings, and overall company and service quality. Conducted on the Text Analytics and Retrieval Workflow (TARFlow) platform, the study employs techniques such as vocabulary standardization, Chinese word segmentation, stop word removal, and Document-Term Matrix (DTM) creation to uncover actionable insights. The findings, supported by association word clouds and detailed categorization, offer data-driven recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction, streamline processes, and drive operational excellence.
